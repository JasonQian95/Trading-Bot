Instructions given:
Hi, I have a request for a data entry job that involves scraping data from Yahoo Finance. Unfortunately their API/download historical data functionality is not working, hence this request (although if you get it to work, it would make the task easier).

Basically, I have a .csv file containing a list of tickers/companies, in the column 'Post-SPAC Ticker Symbol' and dates, in the column 'Completion Date'. For each of these tickers, I want the following data in the following format:

A file named '<Ticker>Price.csv' with 2 columns and 12 rows
The columns are 'Date' and 'Close'
The remaining 11 rows are the 'Completion Date' for that stock and the 'Close' price on that date, from Yahoo Finance, as well as the 5 rows before and after the given date, in order of earliest date to latest date. This data can be found by searching the ticker on Yahoo Finance and going to the 'Historical Data' tab, eg. https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMTX/history?p=BMTX You can create the files in Excel but please save them as .csv files.

In total there are ~100 tickers in this list, 11 days per ticker that I want data for, and 2 values per column, for a total of ~2200 entries

An example:

In the file I will provide:
Post-SPAC Ticker Symbol, Completion Date
BMTX, 1/5/2021

The file I want:
BMTXPrice.csv
Date, Close
12/28/2020, 14.26
12/29/2020, 13.42
12/30/2020, 13.08
12/31/2020, 14.04
1/4/2021, 14.87
1/5/2021, 14.76
1/6/2021, 15.50
1/7/2021, 13.67
1/8/2021, 14.03
1/11/2021, 13.85
1/12/2021, 15.12

If Yahoo does not have the data then data from either of these sites is also acceptable:
